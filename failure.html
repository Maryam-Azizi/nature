				<h3> My failure in learning English</h3>
				<p> 
					I have had many failed efforts in learning English since
					I was a teenager, I do not know what ways are correct
					to learn a foreign language, I had tried to memorize translation
					of words for several years, it did not work. I had gone to some
					classes for learning faster than usual, but it was insufficient either.
					Just after my marriage, I figure the suitable way out which
					was made my spouse success, it was read, listen, write and speak
					with a few little translations in my language and more use English
					to English dictionary with no obsession to understand the whole
					meaning. It is working and my English getting better.

				<h3> My first failure in becoming a programmer</h3>
				<p>
					
				My first failure in becoming a programmer
				it is not my first bad experience in learning how to code, 
				but it is the first after I create this blog. I have learned a
				 bit of HTML and CSS, in other words, all of the things that I know about programming are accumulated in this blog. everything was seemed good, 
				we are in deal with Ehsan which I do every plan that he is designed.
				 Unfortunately, he planed a difficult task with JavaScript that 
				I had never seen before. I surrounded by anxiety, low self-confidence 
				and I could not do that. It needed to know some roles like; If, function,
				 and lots of details for example where you must use semicolons, equal,
				 parentheses and so on( I am not kidding, it was hard for beginners).
				 Finally, I failed to do my task. Ehsan did it very fast and easy for him. 
				I argued about the level of difficulty, I prefer some task with medium challenge. He accepted and has designed a new task that  I will show on the button of this passage as soon as
				it  become complete.
